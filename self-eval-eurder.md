# Örder self-checker
Örder is not only an awesome order management application, it is also a great self-evaluation, done by our best junior java developers.
The goal is not to "get it over with", the goal is to learn & grow:
 - Do I grasp the concepts?
 - Which topics do I get? Where can I challenge myself to go the extra mile?
 - Where do I struggle? Which topics should I work on?
 - Do codereviews on your own code. Make it work + improve and refine it. (for inspiration, look at https://switchfully.slack.com/files/UK99TQ0G6/F0100872XJA/codereview.pdf)
## Which choices did you make in your project
As a developer you have to make choices constantly.
Choices about time efficiency and quality, choices about your architecture, choices about functionality.
Which choices did you make? (List your choices below, remove what is not relevant)
 - What is your focus when working on Örder?
 > Practice the java fundamentals, and learn more advanced stuff (spring, maven, security, logging, DTO's)
 - Do you have a single-module maven project? Or a multi-module maven project?
 > Currently single module, intention is to make it multi-module
 - Are you working test-first?
 > No, test-after
 - Do you have security enabled?
 > Not yet
 - Do you have logging enabled?
 > Not yet
 - What happens if the firstname contains numbers? Is this allowed?
 > First name has to be a string, will implement a verifier
 - In which currency are the prices?
 > Currency is an int called 'priceInEuros', for simplicity's sake
 - Does the phonenumber include the country code?
 > Yes
 - Did you go for a similar architecture as digibooky?
 > I am intending to
 - Is your application deployed in the cloud? (Heroku?)
 > Not yet
